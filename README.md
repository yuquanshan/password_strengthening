# Introduction 
The password strength is reflected by guess probability which is based on Markov chain and PCFG (Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars).

# How to use

## PCFGModel.py

It's used for PCFG-Markov(1-gram) based password strength estimation, see Eq. (1) and (2) in the [paper](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~trj1/papers/acsac13.pdf). It contains a class (PCFGModel) which contains the following attributes and methods:

	characters	-	all possible characters which could appear in the password
	lowercase 	- 	all possible lowrecase characters which could appear in the password
	uppercase 	- 	all possible uppercase characters which could appear in the password
	digit		-	all possible digits which could appear in the password
	symbol 		- 	all possible symbols which could appear in the password, note that it will grow in the training phase (there could be extra UTF-8 symbols to deal with)
	
	pattern_lib	- 	a {pattern:occurence} dictionary storing all patterns and their occurences in the training set
	
	lower_occurence	-	a {length:{sub:occurence}} dictionary storing the occurences of lowercase substrings
	upper_occurence	- 	a {length:{sub:occurence}} dictionary storing the occurences of uppercase substrings
	digit_occurence	- 	a {length:{sub:occurence}} dictionary storing the occurences of digit substrings
	symbol_occurence-	a {length:{sub:occurence}} dictionary storing the occurences of symbol substrings

	lower_occurence_sum	-	a {length:sum}	dictionary storing the total occurence of lowercase substrings with a certain length (in order to accelerate computing)
	upper_occurence_sum	-	a {length:sum} dictionary storing the total occurence of uppercase substrings with a certain length
	digit_occurence_sum	-	a {length:sum} dictionary storing the total occurence of digit substrings with a certain length
	symbol_occurence_sum-	a {length:sum} dictionary storing the total occurence of symbol substrings with a certain length 
	
	lower_firsthit	- 	a {char:occurence} dictionary storing the occurences of the case where a lowercase character appears first in its substring
	upper_firsthit  -       a {char:occurence} dictionary storing the occurences of the case where a uppercase character appears first in its substring
	digit_firsthit  -       a {char:occurence} dictionary storing the occurences of the case where a digit character appears first in its substring
	symbol_firsthit -       a {char:occurence} dictionary storing the occurences of the case where a symbol character appears first in its substring, note that it may grow in the training phase
	
	lower_markov 	-	a {char:list} dictionary storing the markov chain(table) of all lowercase substring
	upper_markov    -       a {char:list} dictionary storing the markov chain(table) of all uppercase substring
	digit_markov    -       a {char:list} dictionary storing the markov chain(table) of all digit substring
	symbol_markov   -       a {char:list} dictionary storing the markov chain(table) of all symbol substring
	
	getPattern(string)	- 	return a pattern of a string, e.g., if the input is "hello123", it turns "L5D3"
	train(file)		- 	train the model with the input file, e.g., train("[rockyou.txt](http://downloads.skullsecurity.org/passwords/rockyou.txt.bz2)")
	getGP(string)		-	calculate the guess probability of a password string (you need to train the model first) 	
	serializeModel(string)	- 	assume after training, this function can be used to export your current model to FS
	deserializeModel(string)- 	this function is used to load an existing PCFG model (in order to skip the lengthy learning phase - jumpstart)
	strengthen(string) 	- 	the core method of the class, strengthen the current password to a new password with relatively lower GP according to PCFG model.
	update(oldpss,newpss)	- 	clear the old password record from the model and update new password to the model

A more concrete example:

	from PCFGModel import PCFGModel
	model = PCFGModel()
	model.train("rockyou.txt")	# will take about 4 min to train
	model.getGP("hello123")		# will return the GP of password "hello123"
	
Alternative you can skip over the training set, since there is a serialized model (trained on "rockyou.txt") available at my [site](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~yxs182/jumpstart.pkl). After downloading it, you can deserialze it by:
	
	from PCFGModel import PCFGModel
	model = PCFGModel()
	model.deserializeModel('jumpstart.pkl')	# will take about half minute, which is much shorter
	
There are jumpstart scripts available, the first version is single process version:
	
	python jumpstart.py rockyou.txt.6.4 	# strengthen rockyou.txt.6.4 based on jumpstart.pkl
	
the second version is a faster multiprocess version (split the to-be-strengthened file into multiple parts and create multiple parallel processes to strengthen their own part, unfortunately they can't share updated model yet):

	python jumpstart_multiprocess.py rockyou.txt.6.4 3	# create three processes to strengthen rockyou.txt.6.4
	
# Tech details (how does strengthen works):

Assume we already have a model in our memory.

	Given the password to be strengthened, and the PCFG model
	if password length == 1
		pick the character with the lowest first-hit probability
	else if password length == 2
		for each possible pattern (16 in total)
			first choose the legit character with the lowest first-hit prob. to replace the first char
			then choose the second character with lowest first-hit/transition prob. 
			(in fact a greedy algorithm for speed)
		pick one with lowest GP among all 16 candidates as our new password
	else if password length <= 5
		enumerate all possible position set (10 at most)
		for each position set 
			get the three characters according to the similar greedy fashion above, use them to replace old characters
			if the new password's GP is smaller than a threshold (10^-16)
				break the loop, use this new pass word as our new password
		pick one with lowest GP as our new passowrd
	else if password length <= 25
		randomly choose several position sets (if would be computationally infeasibile to try all)
		for each position set in those chosen ones:
			get the three characters according to the similar greedy fashion above, use them to replace old characters
			if the new password's GP is smaller than a threshold (10^-20)
				break the loop, use this new pass word as our new password
	else (when password length > 25, then usually it is strong enough, no sophisticated strengthening required)
		randomly choose three positions to replace to see if there is any improvement
	
	Also note that the function to select the characters with lowest first-hit/transition probability also involves randomness (randomly pick several characters and select the lowest among them), for fear that the deterministic selection could be detrimental if part of strengthened passwords are leaked and used in training set.
